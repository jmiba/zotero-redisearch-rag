### A Missouri River Steamboat Is Recovered

### By James V. SwifT WJ Contributing Editor


Another Missouri River steamboat has
been saved from its earthy grave alongside
the Big Muddy. But this one is a little dif-
ferent; it is the vessel itself that is the most
interesting part of the salvage, not the cargo
it carried. There were some items found,
but it is the hull, wheel, engine and boilers
that are noteworthy in the Twilight's exca-
vation.

The Missouri River packet was on its sec-
ond trip of the season when snagged about
5:30 a.m. on September 10, 1865, near the
mouth of Fire Creek, just above Napolean,
Mo., or 20 miles east of Kansas City. A
sycamore tree under the water ripped the
hull, the hog chains snapped, and the Twi-
light broke in two.

Fortunately, the roughly 200 passengers
were all saved.
### Salvage Attempted


The cargo was said to have included
whiskey, which led to attempts at salvage.
Three such excavations were reported,
and while some items were recovered all
were not entirely successful. Then in
1986 the wreck was found again and a
group led by Gene Smith began a careful
plan to uncover the entire boat. In 31/2
months in 200l the entire hull, one side-
wheel, both engines, two boilers, water
pump, anchor, rudder, pitman arms and

capstan were saved. Also the snag that
sank the boat.

These items have been transported to
St. Charles, Mo., and are in storage there,
awaiting a new home. A museum is hoped
for, which would display a real 1865 steam-
boat, not just artifacts from one.

A beautiful book on the Twilight, plus
much history on the Missouri River, has
been issued. Written by Robert Rubright,
it has many illustrations, including views of
the Twilight being excavated.

Michael G. Gunn is coordinator for the
Twilight project. He lives at 325 North
Berry Road, Glendale, Mo. 63122. His
phone numbers are 314, 968-9802 (office),
and 314, 968-1747 (home phone and fax).

A great opportunity to hear him tell
about the Twilight will be on May 26 at
2:30 p.m., when he will be the speaker at
the Golden Eagle River Museum in Bee
Tree Park, St. Louis County, Mo. The pub-
lic is invited and there is no charge.
### More On The Twilight


The steamer Twilight was built in St.
Louis in 1865, so it was a new boat when
sunk. The dimensions were 180 by 32 feet
and the engines were 16 inches in diameter
with a 41/2-foot stroke. The owners were
John P. Keiser, J. Henry, C.M. Sombart
and H.W. McPherson. The Twilight's mas-
ter was Capt. William Massie, well-known
on the Missouri River.

### Cutting Off The View


J.K. Folmar, president of the Mononga-
hela River Buffs Association, has expressed
the opinion, which I share, that highway
departments are ruining views of the river
with their concrete barriers. Folmar is par-
ticularly disturbed because the Pennsylva-
nia Department of Transportation has put
barriers on the Brownsville Bridge over the
Monongahela.

"They ruined a great view of the river,"

he headlines in the March issue Voice of the
Mon, the Monongahela Buffs' newsletter.
Let's start a campaign to open the river
views.

The Voice has a new format that is small-
er than the old one. Their headquarters are
in the attractive museum with lots of mod-
els at 175 Second St., Monongahela, Pa.
The Buffs meet there at 7 p.m. on the third
Tuesday each month, April through Octo-
ber.

The museum has a gift shop with inter-
esting items, including a colorful t-shirt for
$8, reprints of a 1902 Mon River Packet
Company flyer, $2; and a 1923 List of Data:
Coal Mines, Landings & Towns on the
Mon/Allegheny Rivers, $4.

A founder of the Mon Buffs, Ernest
"Weenie" Gabler, died February 18, 2001.
