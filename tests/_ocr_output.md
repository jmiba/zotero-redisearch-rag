Another Missouri River steamboat has been saved from its earthy grave alongside the Big Muddy. But this one is a little different; it is the vessel itself that is the most interesting part of the salvage, not the cargo carried. There were some items found, but it is the hull, wheel, engine and boilers that are noteworthy in the Twilight's excavation.

The Missouri River packet was on its second trip of the season when snagged about 5:30 a.m. on September 10, 1865, near the mouth of Fire Creek, just above Napoleon, Mo., or 20 miles east of Kansas City. A sycamore tree under the water ripped the null, the hog chains snapped, and the Twilight broke in two.

Fortunately, the roughly 200 passengers were all saved.

## Salvage Attempted

The cargo was said to have included whiskey, which led to attempts at salvage. Three such excavations were reported, and while some items were recovered all were not entirely successful. Then in 1986 the wreck was found again and a group led by Gene Smith began a careful plan to uncover the entire boat. In 3½ months in 2001 the entire hull, one sidewheel, both engines, two boilers, water capstan were saved. Also the snag that sank the boat.



These items have been transported to St. Charles, Mo., and are in storage there, awaiting a new home. A museum is hoped for, which would display a real 1865 steamboat, not just artifacts from one.

A beautiful book on the Twilight, plus much history on the Missouri River, has been issued. Written by Robert Rubright, it has many illustrations, including views of the Twilight being excavated.

Michael G. Gunn is coordinator for the Twilight project. He lives at 325 North Berry Road, Glendale, Mo. 63122. His phone numbers are 314, 968-9802 (office), and 314, 968-1747 (home phone and fax).

A great opportunity to hear him tell about the Twilight will be on May 26 at 2:30 p.m., when he will be the speaker at the Golden Eagle River Museum in Bee Tree Park, St. Louis County, Mo. The public is invited and there is no charge.

## More On The Twilight

The steamer Twilight was built in St. Louis in 1865, so it was a new boat when sunk. The dimensions were 180 by 32 feet and the engines were 16 inches in diameter with a 4½-foot stroke. The owners were John P. Keiser, J. Henry, C.M. Sombart and H.W. McPherson. The Twilight's master was Capt. William Massie, well-known

## SSHA Spring Meeting

## Cutting Off The View

J.K. Folmar, president of the Monongahela River Buffs Association, has expressed the opinion, which I share, that highway departments are ruining views of the river with their concrete barriers. Folmar is particularly disturbed because the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation has put barriers on the Brownsville Bridge over the Monongahela.

he headlines in the March issue Voice of the Mon, the Monongahela Buffs' newsletter Let's start a campaign to open the river views.



The Voice has a new format that is smaller than the old one. Their headquarters are in the attractive museum with lots of models at 175 Second St., Monongahela, Pa. The Buffs meet there at 7 p.m. on the third Tuesday each month, April through October.

The museum has a gift shop with interesting items, including a colorful t-shirt for $8, reprints of a 1902 Mon River Packet Company flyer, $2; and a 1923 List of Data Coal Mines, Landings & Towns on the Mon/Allegheny Rivers, $4.
